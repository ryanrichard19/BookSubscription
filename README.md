# End API - .Net Core 3.1, Sqlite DB, Entity Framework, Swagger, Identity, JWT Tokens, XUnit, Moq
I based my architecture and practices around the clean architecture pattern

- set up of project (ORM, Sqlite, Swagger, Indentity, JWT, Xunit and Moq)
- I have created and implemented the Registration and Login end points
- I have created and implemented the book list end point

# Still to do 
- The Book Subscription controller API 
- Unsubscribe End point API
- Returning of User Book Subscriptions to enable unsubscribing of books

# Front End Client - Angular 9

- implemented the landing home page
- added a login component with validation and interaction to the API service
- added a registration component with validation and interaction to the API service
- added a book listing component with interaction to the API service

# Still to do 
- When clicking the subscribe button check if user is logged in - If no redirect the user to the login page - if yes a pop up confirmation should to confirm subscription
- When logged in the user should be able to unsubscribe from a book. When clicking this button a pop up confirmation should appear to confirm this. 
- Clean-up of front end to make it prettier
